The Bird Activity and Environment Monitoring System was developed from my curiosity about bird songs and their correlation with time and weather. 

It is a platform that detects and identifies birds based on their songs using BirdNET, an AI tool from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The system also collects real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, brightness, atmospheric pressure, rain, wind speed, and direction) using various sensors. The data is uploaded in real-time to Google Sheets and Kintone, a cloud data storage platform allowing remote access and control, for the data analysis. Challenges with identification accuracy were addressed by improving microphone quality and adjusting the confidence threshold. The project aims to explore correlations between bird activity, time, and weather, with future goals including data visualization and predictive modeling.

This project was submitted to and presented at [AnimalHack 2024](https://animalhack.org/ah24/). It won [a 2nd place award](https://animalhack2024.devpost.com/project-gallery).
